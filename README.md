#### python is magic

I understand only about 10% of what the hell all this code does, but the worst part is that I couldn't deploy the model the first time I trained it because I did some hacky pickling of ts.keras models, which is unsafe, alright that's fine I guess. So I retrained my model and what the hell why does the recommended method of saving and loading the keras model also not work? I don't know, everything is just black magic.
